# Project Title

Verse3 is an event-based visual programming language (VPL). 

It contains a set of logic blocks that you connect together to build complex applications, business automations, conduct data analysis very quickly.

From the Geometry nodes and Shading nodes in Blender, the Blueprint system in Unreal Engine and Lego Mindstorms for Robotics, VPLs have been used for a wide variety of specialized use cases. Verse3 aims to bridge the various use cases of VPLs in dfferent contexts and address their shortcomings.


## Installation

- Download the SetupVerse3_Win64.msi file and run it to install Verse3.
- Navigate to "C:\Program Files\iiterate Technologies GmbH\Verse3" and run Verse3.exe to run the Verse3 editor application.
- Click on the key icon and log in with your LinkedIn account to access the editor interface
- If you have Rhino 7 installed, download and install Verse3.rhi to test interoperability with Rhino. Run the command Verse3Interop.
- Saving and opening files is disabled in this release.
- This is an EARLY RELEASE - No Warranties. Use at your own risk.
- The primary purpose of this release is to aid user studies for an independent research paper.
    
## Usage/Examples

Verse3 can be used to create parametric, scalable, cloud deployable applications very quickly using node based programming.

So who can use Verse3 and for which use-cases?

- Data Analysts, Data scientists: Quickly conduct data handling and analysis operations visually. These operations can be always done on new settings of data very quickly by adjusting just a few parameters.

- Students: Many educational concepts related to mathematics, computation, coding and design can be visually illustrated very quickly using verse3

- Architects, Computational designers: Complex 3d parametric models for visualisation, analysis, art can be created using Verse3's integrations with other software like Rhino3D.

- Executives, Administrators: Intelligent and adaptive business automations can be quickly created and scaled for use cases like Resource management, customer relationship management, file management, time tracking, etc. Furthermore, automated document generation,invoice generation can be achieved using its features.

- Developers, Designers: Complex concepts can quickly be prototyped, demonstrated and tested using Verse3's capabilities.

## Features

- 𝗘𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘁-𝗯𝗮𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗴𝗿𝗮𝗺𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗴: Similar to UnrealEngine5's Blueprints, it allows the user to program real-time interactions.

- Better UI capabilities: Creating packaged applications with #interactive UI elements like buttons, textboxes, sliders, etc is possible with event programming.

- 𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝘁 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝘀𝗰𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗰𝗵: With no dependencies, written entirely in #CSharp and unattached to any single 3D software - Integrations with Rhinoceros3D, Unity3D and ThreeJS are already in the roadmap.

- Interoperability 𝗦𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗯𝗼𝘅: Being OpenSource allows for developers to create powerful Interop pipelines and plugins.

- Cloud-𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗱𝘆: Designed to compute "headlessly" and securely, it's much simpler to deploy on unmanaged servers. This means that it could theoretically power SaaS platforms similar to ShapeDiver or Hypar.

- MVVM-𝗯𝗮𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝗘𝗱𝗶𝘁𝗼𝗿 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗮𝗰𝗲: Those familiar with ReactJS, VueJS, AngularJS or WPF will recognize that this makes it possible to have web-based editors using Blazor and JavaScript.

- 𝗦𝘁𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗺𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗱 𝗽𝗹𝘂𝗴𝗶𝗻 𝗱𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹𝗼𝗽𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁: With a simpler SDK interface, developing a plugin or migrating one from Grasshopper is as straightforward as possible.

## FAQs

#### What can Verse3 be used for?

Verse3 can be used for business automation, data analysis, parametric modelling, personal automations, education and much more!

#### Why do we need this VPL?

VPLs have been used for a wide variety of specialized use cases. Verse3 aims to bridge the various use cases of VPLs in dfferent contexts and address their shortcomings.
